# C Printf Project

This `printf` project was built by [Abas Ubon]() and [Alexander Udeogaranya](). The objective of this project was to help us apply most of the concepts we have learnt so far in C into building a mini project. Also, it objectives was to help us understand how to collaborate with other developers, and also to make us have an understanding of how the C `printf` function actually works.
